# Level Renderer

## Description

The Level Renderer is a powerful software tool designed to render 3D scenes created in Blender using openGL, GLSL shaders, and C++. It enables the conversion of Blender files into a text format through a Python script and provides advanced rendering capabilities including lighting, shadows, bloom post-processing, multiple viewports, and object-oriented loading approach.

## Key Features

- Conversion of Blender files: The Level Renderer includes a Python script that facilitates the conversion of Blender files into a text format, allowing for easy integration with the rendering pipeline.
- OpenGL Rendering: Utilizing the power of OpenGL, the Level Renderer provides high-performance rendering of 3D scenes, ensuring smooth and realistic visuals.
- GLSL Shaders: The software leverages GLSL shaders to enhance the rendering pipeline, enabling advanced effects such as lighting, shadows, and bloom post-processing.
- Multiple Viewports: With support for multiple viewports, the Level Renderer allows users to have a comprehensive overview of their scenes from different perspectives, enhancing the editing and debugging process.
- Object-Oriented Loading Approach: The software employs an object-oriented loading approach, promoting code reusability and facilitating the management of multiple objects within a scene.
- Developed by Miguel Martinez: The Level Renderer is a personal project created and maintained by Miguel Martinez, showcasing his skills as a graphics programmer, forward thinker, and proficiency in C++.
